Sumatra 0.8.0 release notes
===========================

*18th April 2025*

It is almost ten years since the last release of Sumatra!

In part this is because Sumatra 0.7.4 was stable, and seemed to meet the needs of its users,
in part it is because the main developer was working on other scientific software,
for which he got funding!

The usefulness of Sumatra has not diminished in this time, however;
if anything, the need for carefully keeping track of project dependencies
has only increased, as the pace of development in scientific software ecosystems
has accelerated.

This release of Sumatra has essentially the same features as 0.7.4,
but has been updated to support more recent versions of Python
and other dependencies, particularly Django.
We have dropped support for Python 2.7, and formally only support Python 3.9 or later.
